Flow Lock Implementation
------------------------

This is the Flow implementation of a lock mechanism, that was used in Flow. As of
Flow 6.0 it is no longer used and will be developed independently, if needed.

Feel free to create issues and PRs regarding version 6.0 and up in this repository.
If you want to open a PR that should go into any version below 6.0, please do so at
https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection 

If you want to use the Flow framework, please have a look at the `Flow documentation
<http://flowframework.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_

.. note:: This repository was a **read-only subsplit** of a package that was part of the
Flow framework until version 6.0 (learn more on `flow.neos.io <http://flow.neos.io/>`_).

If you want to contribute to the Flow framework in general, please have a look at
https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection - it is the repository used for
development and all pull requests should go into it.
