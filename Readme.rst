Flow Lock Implementation
------------------------

This is the Flow implementation of a lock mechanism, that was used in Flow. As of
Flow 6.0 it is no longer used in Flow and will be developed independently as needed.

Feel free to create issues and PRs regarding version 6.0 and up in this repository.

If you want to use the Flow framework, please have a look at the `Flow documentation
<http://flowframework.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_

.. note:: This repository was a **read-only subsplit** of a package that was part of the
  Flow framework until version 5.3 (learn more on `flow.neos.io <http://flow.neos.io/>`_).

As of version 6.0.0 this leads a life it's own.

If you want to contribute to the Flow framework in general, please have a look at
https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection - it is the repository used for
development and all pull requests should go into it.
